High level summary of what changed since our proposal
=====================================================

- Rewrote introduction to better highlight research contributions
- Renamed "Literature Survey" to "Related Work" and rewrote the section to focus on highlighting how our work differs from existing work (as opposed to enumerating existing approaches)
- Introduced a new section "Backgroud" that summarizes the technologies and algorithms underlying our work.
- Move discussion of foundation technologies (GFS/HDFS, BigTable/HBase, Chubby/Zookeeper) into Background section and align with publications
- New section in Background to explain multiversion timestamp ordering
- Removed "Method" section and replaced it with one section describing the Transaction Manager and one section describing the entity group detection algorithm
